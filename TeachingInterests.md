I would like to teach courses on methods, comparative politics, and political economy.  Below are examples of courses I would like to teach, though it is not an extensive list.
 
Methodology: Introductory courses on linear models and maximum likelihood estimation, and advanced courses on Multilevel Models; Bayesian Statistics; Measurement and Latent Variable Models; Text Analysis; Statistical Programming.
 
Comparative Politics: Introduction to Comparative Politics; Comparative Political Institutions; Comparative Presidential Systems,  Policy-Making Process;  Comparative Judicial Politics; the Politics of Electoral Systems; Spatial Models of Party Competition;  Legislative Politics; or Democratic Representation, Responsiveness, and Accountability (for which I have created a sample syllabus). I can also teach a variety of introductory or advanced courses on Latin American Politics.
 
Political Economy: Introduction to Political Economy; Comparative Political Economy; Economic Causes and Consequences of Political Institutions; Democratic Institutions and Economic Policy; Presidents, Legislators, and Economic Policy in Latin America
