title: About me
subtitle: Postdoctoral Fellow in Political Methodology and Data Science
---

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Political Methodology and Data Science at the University of Virginia. I recently received a PhD in Political Science at Washington University in Saint Louis. How political institutions affect the correspondence between the policies that citizens and representatives desire and the outcomes that democratic governments produce is the core concern that motivates my research agenda. My work incorporates Bayesian statistics, hierarchical modeling, and the measurement of complex concepts using latent-trait models.
