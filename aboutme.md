I am a *Postdoctoral Fellow in Political Methodology and Data Science* at the Department of Politics, University of Virginia. I recently received a PhD in Political Science at Washington University in Saint Louis. In a nutshell, my research uses Bayesian statistics to uncover the effects of political institutions on elite and citizen behavior. I have a particular interest in the measurement of complex concepts, the analysis of multilevel data structures, and the application of texts-as-data.
