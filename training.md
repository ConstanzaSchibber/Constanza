title: Training in Statistics
---

I have acquired a comprehensive knowledge of statistics through rigorous training at Washington University in Saint Louis.  I also have a keen interest in programming and a passion for teaching statistics for the social sciences.

## Formal Course Work at Washington University in Saint Louis

*Required Methods Sequence* 

* Mathematical Modeling in Political Science

* Quantitative Political Methodology I (OLS)

* Quantitative Political Methodology II (MLE)

*Elective Courses*

* Multilevel Models in Quantitative Research (Jeff Gill, Center for Applied Statistics)

* Statistical Computing for Scientific Research (Computer Science Department/Political Science Department)

* Bayesian Statistics (Department of Mathematics)

* Seminar in Econometrics (Prof. Sid Chib, Business School)

* Seminar in Bayesian Statistics (Jeff Gill, Reading Seminar in Applied Statistics)

* Factor Analysis and Related Methods (Center for Applied Statistics)

## Additional Training & Related Activities

- Methods Workshop, Political Science Department, 2014-2015

- Quantitative Methods Reading Group (lead by Jeff Gill, 2011/2012)

- Natural Experiments I & II (Thad Dunning and Daniel Hidalgo, IQMR, Summer 2012)

- Computer Assisted Text Analysis (Will Lowe and Sven-Oliver Proksch, IQMR, Summer 2012)
  - I have worked on an application of a Latent Dirichlet Allocation model using the text of the bills introduced by legislators in Argentina and in Brazil in the past 10 years. Specifically, I relied on the text in which they explained to the public why they wanted to introduce a bill to uncover the topics of the bills. I plan to rely on these data and models in my future work. A summary of the [Model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0p05uw13w55fpmq/LDA_TopicBills.pdf?dl=0) and the [Python code](https://github.com/ConstanzaSchibber/) is available.

## Teaching & Programming Workshops

Currently, I am teaching **Generalized Linear Models** (graduate level) in the Department of Politics at the University of Virginia. I will be teaching Hierarchical Models in Spring 2017. While I was at WUStL, I served as teaching assistant for three methods courses. I have also taught a number of workshops in R and Python programming, you can get slides and code for these workshops on my [Teaching](https://constanzaschibber.github.io/teaching/) page.
